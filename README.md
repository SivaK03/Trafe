# Trafe
This repo has the files regarding the Nationwide HackerEarth Hackathon
Team Members are Akash Kosaraju, Gokul Krishnan, Sivakumar Kunapuli, Adrian Fernando, Moez Ahamed. 

There are two important files: the "src.zip" file which has the image detection algorithm and the "trafe_maps.zip", this file has the code for the maps activity that was mentioned within the presentation. 


The maps was not able to be integrated with the image detection algorithm because in order to use the google maps api key, you have to pay for it. \
